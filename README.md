## [22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

- [2,27,16,22,18,6] -> 2 to 22 swapping places.
- [2,6,16,22,18,27] -> 6 to 27 swapping places.
- [2,6,16,22,18,27] -> The 3rd row element is the smallest. No need to change.
- [2,6,16,18,22,27] -> 18 to 22 swapping places.
- [2,6,16,18,22,27] -> The 5th row element is the smallest. No need to change.
- [2,6,16,18,22,27] -> The 6th row element is the biggest and finish.

### Big-O 
-  O(n²) = O(6²) = O(36)

#### Time Complexity
- > **Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle,**
- > Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end,
- > Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the array.
